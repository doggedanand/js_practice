# JavaScript Problem-Solving & Logic Projects 🧩

This repository contains my collection of **solved JavaScript coding questions** and **mini logic-based projects**.  
It’s a personal space to practice algorithms, problem-solving, and sharpen my JavaScript skills.  
Currently, it has **60+ solved questions**, and I’ll keep adding more in the future 🚀.

## 📂 What’s inside?
- 🔄 String problems (reverse string, palindrome, anagrams, etc.)  
- 🔢 Number problems (Fibonacci series, prime numbers, factorial, etc.)  
- 🔎 Searching & sorting algorithms (binary search, selection sort, etc.)  
- 🎮 Mini logical projects (Snake-Water-Gun game, guess-the-number, etc.)  
- 📈 More challenges coming soon…  

## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen **problem-solving skills** using JavaScript  
- Understand **algorithms and logic building**  
- Build small fun projects to apply the concepts  

## ✅ Progress
- ✔️ 60+ questions solved  
- 🚧 More questions & projects will be added regularly  

## 🤝 Contributing
This is mainly a personal learning repo, but if you have fun challenge ideas, feel free to suggest them!  

## 📌 Note
The repo is a **work in progress** — it will grow as I continue solving new questions and creating mini projects.  
Stay tuned for updates! ⚡
